<h4>Dear {{$reciever_name}},</h4>
<p>
    Please be informed that <b>{{$employee_name}}</b> has commenced working with <b>{{$company}}</b> last <b>{{$date_hired}}</b>. In this regard, we are requesting for the 5th month evaluation review please. Another performance evaluation should be discussed with the new employee/s prior to their regularization date, which should determine their employment status (regularization or termination of employment).
</p>
<p>
    Should you recommend her for regularization, please accomplish the Performance Evaluation and submit to HR on or before <b>Date of Submission (2 weeks before regularization date)</b> please. The approved document should be provided to HR Team with explicit notation on regularization/non regularization.
</p>
<p>
    Please be reminded that once the employee reaches 6th month (<b>{{$date_of_regularization}}</b>), without feedback or notice sent to HR, the employee would assume regular employment, as mandated by law.
</p>
<p>
    Feel free to contact Ella Joy Villaplaza thru Webex or email ellajoy.villaplaza@lafilipinauygongco.com for further clarifications regarding the regularization process.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you,
